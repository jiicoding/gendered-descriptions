I want to read books that explore the full humanity of their characters, not books that reduce both men and women to weak stereotypes of their gender."},{"type":"text","value":"Before getting too upset, though, I wanted to see if this lazy writing was as widespread as it seemed or if I was just succumbing to selective reading. Do authors really mention particular body parts more for men than for women? Are female bodies described using different adjectives than male bodies?"},{"type":"text","value":"To do this, I selected 2,000 books spanning from Pulitzer-winning classics to pulpy best-sellers (getting myself banned from the library—twice), and ran them through a parser that identified sentences mentioning body parts. I could then extract the owner of the body parts and any adjectives describing them."}]}
